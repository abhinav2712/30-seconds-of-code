Verifies if an email address is valid using regular expressions.

- In this code snippet, we define a function called `validateEmail` that takes an email address as its parameter. We use a regular expression to check if the email address is valid. If the email address matches the regular expression, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.
- We then call the function with an example email address,  `"example@domain.com"`, and store the result in a variable called `isValid`. Finally, we log the value of isValid to the console, which should be true.
- This code snippet is useful for verifying user input in web forms and other applications, where it is important to ensure that the data entered by the user is in the correct format.

```js
function validateEmail(email) {
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return regex.test(email);
}
```

```js
const email = "example@domain.com";
const isValid = validateEmail(email);
console.log(isValid); // true
```
